# ⚡ LocalCode

**An AI coding agent that runs entirely in your terminal — no cloud account required.**  
Point it at a local model (Ollama, LM Studio, or llama.cpp) and start building. With llama.cpp, LocalCode can auto-download and auto-start the server for you, run multiple models at once on separate ports, and proactively manage context so long agentic sessions don't run out of room.

## What it does

LocalCode is an autonomous AI coding agent with a keyboard-driven terminal UI. Describe a task — the agent reads your codebase, edits files, runs commands, and commits to git. Every write operation shows a diff preview and asks for confirmation before applying.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- A running **local LLM server** — Ollama, LM Studio, or llama.cpp (`llama-server`)

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g localcode-agent
```

Then run it inside any project:

```bash
localcode
```

---

## Quick start

### 1. Start a local model server

**Ollama** (recommended — free, Linux / macOS / Windows)

```bash
# Install from https://ollama.com, then:
ollama serve
ollama pull deepseek-coder
```

**LM Studio** — download from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai), load a model, click **Start Local Server**.

**llama.cpp** — no setup needed. Just switch the provider and LocalCode handles the rest (see [Local llama.cpp management](#local-llamacpp-management) below):

```
/config provider llamacpp
```

---

### 2. Connect

On first launch, type `/connect` to open the connection popup, pick your provider, and enter the address. The config is saved to `~/.localcode/config.json`.

---

### 3. Give it a task

```bash
localcode fix the auth bug in src/auth.ts
localcode add unit tests for the user service
localcode explain the architecture of this project
```

Or just open the TUI and type naturally.

---

## Local llama.cpp management

When the provider is `llamacpp`, LocalCode manages the server for you — no separate terminal, no manual `llama-server` command.

### Zero-setup auto-start

```
/config provider llamacpp
```

On every launch, LocalCode checks whether a server is already reachable. If not, it auto-downloads a prebuilt `llama-server` binary for your OS/arch (from the official [llama.cpp releases](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases)) plus a small default model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) on first use, then starts it — no model, no binary, no manual setup required. Everything lands under `~/.localcode/llamacpp/`.

The server is started **detached** — it keeps running after you quit LocalCode, so the next launch reuses the already-warm process instead of reloading the model from scratch.

### Using your own models

```
/config llamacpp modelsdir "D:\path\to\your\models"     # e.g. an LM Studio models folder
/models local                                            # lists every .gguf found, numbered
/config llamacpp model 2                                 # pick by number — or pass a full path directly
/config llamacpp context 32768                            # set context length (keeps other flags)
/config llamacpp args -t 96 --numa distribute             # advanced: raw llama-server flags
/restart                                                   # apply changes without quitting the TUI
```

`/models local` skips `mmproj-*` vision-projector files and only picks part `00001` of a multi-part split `.gguf` — llama.cpp loads the rest automatically. Changing the model, port, or args and running `/restart` (or just relaunching) safely restarts the managed server — it checks what the live server is *actually* serving before touching anything, and only ever stops a process it has positively identified as `llama-server`.

### Multiple models at once

Run several models concurrently, each on its own port, and switch between them — e.g. a large model for coding, a small fast one for quick questions:

```
/config llamacpp agent coding model "D:\models\Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Q4_K_M.gguf"
/config llamacpp agent coding port 8080
/config llamacpp agent coding context 32768

/config llamacpp agent quick model "D:\models\Ministral-3B-Instruct.gguf"
/config llamacpp agent quick port 8081

/use coding      # starts it if needed, points the active session at it
/use quick        # switches without stopping "coding" in the background
/agents           # lists all agents — running/stopped, active one marked ▶
/agents stop quick
/agents remove quick
```

### Reliability

- **Prompt caching** — requests set `cache_prompt: true`, so llama-server reuses the KV cache for the unchanged conversation prefix between turns instead of reprocessing the whole growing history from scratch on every agent iteration.
- **Idle timeout** — if a request genuinely stalls (CPU contention, an oversized context) with no new data for 15 minutes, it aborts with a clear error instead of hanging silently forever. This is an idle timeout, not a hard deadline, so a large context that's still legitimately making progress isn't cut off.
- **Configured-but-missing paths fail loudly** — a typo'd `/config llamacpp model` path errors immediately instead of silently falling back to the default model.

---

## Confirmation & trust

Every file write and shell command asks for confirmation before running:

```
Allow  Write file: src/auth.ts
[y] yes  /  [n] no  /  [t] trust folder
```

- **`y`** — approve once
- **`t`** — trust the folder permanently (all future ops in this path and subfolders are auto-approved, including new files)
- **`n`** — deny

Dangerous operations (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, force-push, etc.) always require explicit confirmation even in trusted folders.

Manage trusted paths:
```
/trust .                  # trust current directory
/trust /home/user/project # trust absolute path
/trust                    # list all trusted paths
/trust remove <path>      # remove trust
```

---

## BUILD vs PLAN mode

Press `Tab` (with empty input) to toggle between modes:

- **BUILD** — agent uses tools, edits files, runs commands
- **PLAN** — agent thinks through the task and returns a structured plan without touching anything

---

## File reading

The agent reads entire files. For large files it shows the total line count and supports ranged reads:

```json
{"tool": "read_file", "arguments": {"path": "src/big.ts", "start_line": 100, "end_line": 200}}
```

---

## Conversation history & context

The last 60 messages are kept in context and sent to the model each iteration. Use `/compact` to summarize and free up context anytime.

**Proactive auto-compact** (llama.cpp, when a context length is configured via `/config llamacpp context <n>`): each turn's actual token usage — reported directly by the provider, not an estimate — is checked against your configured context size. Crossing 87% triggers `/compact` automatically before things break, instead of only recovering after a request already crashed from exceeding the context window.

---

## Discord Rich Presence

LocalCode shows your current status in Discord ("Idle", "Thinking…", "Running agent") with the active folder name and elapsed time.

It connects automatically to Discord if it is running. No setup needed for users — just install and go.

---

## Configuration file

`~/.localcode/config.json` is created automatically. Direct editing is supported:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "llamacpp",
    "model": "qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf",
    "baseURL": "http://localhost:8080/v1",
    "temperature": 0.1
  },
  "llamaCppServer": {
    "modelPath": "D:\\models\\your-model.gguf",
    "modelsDir": "D:\\models",
    "extraArgs": "-c 32768 -t 96 --numa distribute"
  },
  "llamaCppAgents": {
    "quick": { "modelPath": "D:\\models\\small-model.gguf", "port": "8081" }
  },
  "trustedPaths": [
    "/home/user/projects/myapp"
  ]
}
```

---

## What the agent can do

- Read, write, edit, move, copy, delete files
- Search inside files (grep) and find files by pattern
- Run any shell command (PowerShell on Windows, bash on Linux/macOS)
- Create git commits
- Fetch URLs and make HTTP requests
- Run LSP diagnostics (tsc, cargo check, go vet, ruff/pyflakes, eslint, rubocop, dotnet build, and more)
- Get hover info and jump-to-definition via real LSP servers (typescript-language-server, rust-analyzer, gopls, pylsp, clangd)
- Retry automatically on errors and try alternative approaches when a tool fails

---

## Error recovery

If the LLM stream fails, the agent retries up to 3 times automatically. If a tool returns an error, the model is told to try a different approach and continue rather than stopping.

---

## Plugins

LocalCode supports plugins — Node.js modules that add custom slash commands and tools.

```bash
/plugin install ./my-plugin.js
/plugin list
/plugin remove my-plugin
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Ollama is not reachable"**  
Run `ollama serve` and check the URL with `/doctor`.

**"LM Studio is not reachable"**  
Load a model in LM Studio and click **Start Local Server** (default port 1234).

**"llama.cpp is not reachable"**  
Normally auto-starts on its own — check `/doctor` for what's wrong. If auto-start failed, the error is printed on launch before the TUI opens.

**"Configured model not found: ..."**  
`/config llamacpp model` or `binary` points at a path that doesn't exist. Double check it with `/config llamacpp` (no args) — this fails loudly on purpose instead of silently falling back to the default model.

**"llama.cpp request timed out" / "stream stalled"**  
No response for 15 minutes — usually the CPU is busy with something else, or the context is too large to process in time. Free up CPU, lower `/config llamacpp context <n>`, or just retry.

**"Model not found"**  
Use `/models` to list loaded models, `/model` to switch.

**TUI looks broken / garbled**  
Requires a UTF-8 terminal with 256-color support.  
Use **Windows Terminal** on Windows, or any modern terminal on macOS / Linux (iTerm2, Ghostty, Alacritty, kitty, etc.).

## Language Intelligence (LSP)

LocalCode integrates with real **Language Server Protocol** servers to give the agent (and you) IDE-quality language intelligence — the same engine powering VS Code, Neovim, and others.

### What it does

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Diagnostics** (`/lsp`) | Runs errors and warnings via CLI tools (tsc, eslint, cargo check, …) |
| **Hover** (`/lsp hover`) | Gets the type, signature, or docs for any symbol |
| **Go-to-definition** (`/lsp def`) | Finds where any symbol is defined |

The agent also has access to `lsp_hover` and `lsp_definition` as tools — it can look up types and definitions on its own while working.

### Supported LSP servers

| Language | Server | Install |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `typescript-language-server` | `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript` |
| Rust | `rust-analyzer` | [rust-analyzer.github.io](https://rust-analyzer.github.io) |
| Go | `gopls` | `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` |
| Python | `pylsp` | `pip install python-lsp-server` |
| C / C++ | `clangd` | [clangd.llvm.org](https://clangd.llvm.org) |

Servers are **optional** — if none is installed for a language, `/lsp` still works via CLI tools. Hover and definition require the LSP server to be installed and on your `PATH`.

### Usage

```
# Run diagnostics (CLI-based, always works):
/lsp
/lsp src/auth.ts

# Hover — get type info for the symbol at line 42, col 15:
/lsp hover src/auth.ts:42:15

# Go-to-definition — find where a symbol is defined:
/lsp def src/auth.ts:42:15
```

LSP servers start automatically on the first request and stay running in the background for fast subsequent calls.
